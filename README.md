# Cyclistic_bike

The Cyclistic bike-share company targets to convert as many casual members as possible into annual members. 
Therefore we will try to gain some insight from the data to identify differences and patterns between annual and casual members.
Our primary question is "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"


A data analysis project operated during the Google Data Analysis Certificate. 
The context of the project is to analyse trends and data for the Cyclistic application in the city of Chicago.
